            <h3> The General Goals of an Academic Libraries and its Effectiveness</h3>
            <p>The function of academic libraries is to preserve information, provide access to information, help people find and use information, and provide study spaces and access to hardware and software for learning and scholarship. Library Service means a service that provides reading materials for convenient use; circulation of reading materials; service to help provide users with library materials, educational and recreational audiovisual materials; or a combination of these services.
              An academic library is a library associated with a college or university which supports the mission of the institution and the research needs of its faculty, staff and students. Although it is possible that a purely virtual library could exist, no brick and mortar institution has yet taken that step.</p>

          <h3>The difference between academic library and school library</h3>
          <p>An academic library, on the other hand, is typically affiliated with a college, university, or research institution. It is more specialized and focused on supporting the research and academic needs of the institution's students, faculty, and researchers. Academic libraries often have extensive collections of scholarly materials, including academic journals, specialized databases, and rare or unique manuscripts. They also provide support for in-depth research and often have specialized librarians who can assist with complex research inquiries.</p>
